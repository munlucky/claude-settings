# Removed Legacy Instructions

## Result: nothing was removed

The Wave 1 investigation searched every Kernel prompt surface for the legacy
patterns the work guide lists (§8.2), in English and Korean:

```
always plan first / always verify / verify again / double-check
recheck before responding / review your own answer
use a subagent to verify / always delegate / ask another agent
run the full suite after every change / explain every step / report every tool call
do not think / do not reason
항상 먼저 계획 / 반드시 다시 검증 / 응답 전에 재확인 / 서브에이전트에게 검증
모든 수정 후 전체 테스트 / 작업 과정을 계속 설명 / 사고하지 마라 / 추론하지 마라
```

Surfaces searched (see `prompt-inventory.json`):

- `skills/moon-relay-kernel/SKILL.md`
- `package/profile-templates/claude/.claude/agents/kernel-{planner,implementer,reviewer}.md`
- `package/profile-templates/codex/.codex/AGENTS.md`
- `scripts/host/kernel/**` (adapters, turn dispatcher, model registry)
- `scripts/kernel/**` prompt assembly (`context-build.mjs`, `knowledge/context-render.mjs`)

**No surface matched.** Every hit in the repository was in Relay-mode skills
(`skills/figma-spec-synthesizer`, `skills/vercel-react-best-practices`,
`skills/frontend-design`) that the Kernel Host does not load, which §8.1 places
out of scope. Two of those matches are domain guidance about verifying auth
inside Server Actions — unrelated to model execution policy.

The guide is explicit that only confirmed items may be removed, and that Kernel
evidence, review, and completion authority must not be mistaken for legacy
instruction. Deleting nothing is the correct outcome here, not a skipped step.

## What the wave did instead

The duplication the wave targets was not *legacy text to delete* but *common
behavior with no single home*. That gap is now closed:

| Concern | Single location |
|---|---|
| Common scope / autonomy / verification / delegation rules | `scripts/host/kernel/prompts/common-execution.mjs` |
| Conditional planning, verification order, delegation gate | `scripts/host/kernel/common-model-policy.mjs` |
| Claude thinking, effort, cache breakpoints, output artifacts | `scripts/host/kernel/prompts/claude-opus-5.mjs`, `claude-effort-policy.mjs` |
| Codex routing, profiles, session, fast mode, API capability gate | `scripts/host/kernel/prompts/codex-gpt-5p6.mjs`, `codex-model-policy.mjs`, `codex-profile-materializer.mjs`, `codex-agents-policy.mjs` |
| Run/step/capsule identifiers | `scripts/host/kernel/prompt-envelope.mjs` `control` (never in a prompt segment) |

`tests/kernel-prompt-legacy-instruction.test.mjs` now fails if any of the
patterns above is reintroduced into a Kernel prompt surface, so this audit is
enforced rather than recorded.
