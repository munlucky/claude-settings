# Project Memory Update & Commit

Supported public utility entrypoint. Use only when the user explicitly wants memory refresh plus commit.

## 역할

- refresh project memory before commit
- keep the memory summary short
- exclude `.claude/memory.json` and `.claude/memorygraph/` from commits by default after refreshing memory
- create a Korean commit title and grouped bullet body

## 명시적 호출

Run only for `$commit-moonshot` or an explicit equivalent request.

## 절차

1. inspect staged changes with compact git commands
2. resolve `PROJECT_ID` through the Project Identity Resolver; do not derive durable identity directly from the current directory name
3. run `node <MOONSHOT_RELAY_HOME>/scripts/commit-moonshot-memory-refresh.mjs --project-id <PROJECT_ID>` when the project has the script; if a prior `mcp__memory__.store_memory` call failed, pass the same payload through `--store-json @<payload-file>` and the MCP error through `--mcp-error`
4. run `node <MOONSHOT_RELAY_HOME>/scripts/commit-moonshot-promotion-audit.mjs --project-id <PROJECT_ID> --json` when the project has the script; this is audit-only by default
5. summarize created or updated memory facts, direct fallback route, AWTL promotion audit counts, and promotion candidates in a short bullet list
6. keep `.claude/memory.json`, `.claude/memorygraph/`, and `.claude/cache/memorygraph/` unstaged unless the user explicitly asks to include memory artifacts
7. build a filtered staging path list before `git add`; remove generated bridge paths, ignored files, and local MCP/memory artifacts
8. create the commit in Korean

## 중단 조건

- always refresh memory before commit
- do not read `.moonshot-relay/docs/ko/` as a memory source; it is a human-facing Korean mirror
- do not store facts derived only from `.moonshot-relay/docs/ko/`
- do not store system, developer, `AGENTS.md`, `.claude/rules/**`, or workflow hard rules as project memory; record duplicates under `projectMemory.omitted.duplicatedSystemRules`
- never auto-stage account-root knowledge state, `.claude/memory.json`, or `.claude/memorygraph/` by default
- never auto-stage `.claude/cache/memorygraph/` by default
- never auto-stage generated agent bridge paths such as `.agents/` or `.agents/skills`; omit them from explicit `git add -- <paths>` lists unless the user explicitly asks to track generated bridge files
- never run `git add -A -- .agents`, `git add -A -- .agents/skills`, or any generated explicit path list that still contains `.agents` or `.agents/skills`
- before running `git add -- <paths>`, filter the candidate path list with these deny patterns: `.agents`, `.agents/**`, `.mcp.json`, `.claude/memory.json`, `.claude/memorygraph/**`, `.claude/cache/memorygraph/**`
- if the candidate list was produced from tool output or a previous assistant step, re-check it manually before execution; ignored/generated paths must be removed even when they appear in the user's pasted command
- prefer root directories and policy files for installer commits: `.claude`, `.codex`, `.claudeignore`, `.gitattributes`, `.gitignore`, `AGENTS.md`, plus any explicitly changed product docs/code; never include `.agents`
- only stage memory artifacts when the user explicitly asks to include memory in the commit
- if MemoryGraph MCP is unavailable, treat it as `mcp_transport_failed -> direct_fallback`; record the failure only after the direct fallback also fails, then continue the Git closeout when the user explicitly requested commit/push
- do not auto-promote project candidates into `moonshot-relay` during a normal project commit; run the AWTL promotion audit and write only when `--write-verified` is justified by replay evidence or explicit approval
- use `commit-moonshot-promotion-audit.mjs --write-verified` only when the user explicitly asked for long-term promotion, for example `장기메모리승격 포함`, `승격 승인`, or `write verified memory`
- keep failed-turn cases as next-run recall cache; do not treat `.claude/cache/awtl/failed_turn_cases.jsonl` itself as a long-term MemoryGraph source
- warn before committing when product implementation changes are mixed with `<MOONSHOT_RELAY_HOME>/scripts/**`, `.claude/skills/**`, or `.claude/verification.contract.yaml` changes
- require `QA_REPORT.md` to contain a `Harness Change Ledger` entry when harness/tool changes were made during a product phase
- for Moonshot Relay harness/package/profile changes, require full Operational Adoption Closeout evidence before claiming commit-ready state: independent completion audit, independent operational adoption audit, source `doctor.mjs check --json`, `skills-audit.mjs audit --lock skills.lock.json --runtime-surface package/runtime-surface.json --json`, `npm run test:lab`, `npm run test:package`, `npm run test:eval`, `npm test`, package dry-run, and, when live account-root adoption occurred, live install `installId`, installed doctor with explicit `--repo-root`, `--lock`, and `--runtime-surface` paths, installer JSON `profileSurfaceParity`, and `profileSurfaceParity[runtime=codex].extraCanonicalCount=0`
- when commit/push closeout is requested, do not claim push completion until `git rev-parse HEAD` equals `git rev-parse origin/<branch>` after `git push`; record this parity result with the push closeout evidence
- keep the user-facing summary and commit body grouped by feature area
- keep the summary compact; avoid long prose dumps
- when a phase runner `runId` and `goalId` are available, pass them to commit memory/audit helpers so commit closeout writes runtime events under the active identity
- if no active runtime identity exists, helpers use an audit-only commit closeout identity; that identity is evidence only and must not be treated as whole-plan completion authority
- record staging, commit, and push outcomes through `node <MOONSHOT_RELAY_HOME>/scripts/commit-moonshot-closeout-event.mjs --event-type <type> --payload-json <json> --json`; do not hand-write ad hoc `runtime-state record-event` calls for commit closeout taxonomy

## Codex MCP Transport Fallback

On `Transport closed`, use `commit-moonshot-memory-refresh.mjs` with the same payload and MCP error. Load `references/commit-closeout-internals.md` for transport and platform details.

## AWTL Promotion Audit

Run the audit helper before staging when available. Promotion remains audit-only unless the user explicitly authorizes verified writes; detailed counters and replay rules live in `references/commit-closeout-internals.md`.

## 출력 계약

Report memory disposition, verification, staged paths, commit identity, and push or remote parity status.

User context: $ARGUMENTS

## Project Knowledge Boundary

Default to the account-root project knowledge namespace under `${MOONSHOT_RELAY_HOME:-~/.moonshot-relay}/state/projects/`.

Commit closeout memory refresh is non-blocking. It can refresh or audit project knowledge after verification, but it is not part of attempt/system prompt assembly and must not put raw MemoryGraph/KG/ontology/log/transcript payloads into commit summaries or manifests.

Git closeout may record only knowledge refresh status, warning codes, and promotion/audit counts. MemoryGraph transport failure must not block commit/push when the user explicitly requested Git closeout.

Account-root project knowledge state is runtime state, not a commit payload. Repo commits may include reviewed summaries, evidence manifests, contracts, or explicit promotion candidates, but not raw knowledge state.

Commit closeout runtime event taxonomy:

- `commit.closeout.started`
- `commit.memory_refresh.completed`
- `commit.memory_refresh.failed`
- `commit.memory_refresh.skipped`
- `commit.promotion_audit.completed`
- `commit.promotion_audit.failed`
- `commit.promotion_audit.skipped`
- `commit.staging.selected`
- `commit.created`
- `commit.failed`
- `commit.push.skipped`
- `commit.push.requested`
- `commit.push.completed`
- `commit.push.failed`

These events are audit evidence only. They must not create or imply an accepted `completion_decisions` row.

Use the closeout event helper for Git outcomes after memory refresh and promotion audit:

```sh
node <MOONSHOT_RELAY_HOME>/scripts/commit-moonshot-closeout-event.mjs \
  --project-id <PROJECT_ID> \
  --run-id <RUN_ID> \
  --goal-id <GOAL_ID> \
  --workspace-id <WORKSPACE_ID> \
  --event-type commit.staging.selected \
  --payload-json '{"selectedCount":0,"status":"selected"}' \
  --json
```

Then record `commit.created`, `commit.failed`, `commit.push.skipped`, `commit.push.requested`, `commit.push.completed`, or `commit.push.failed` with sanitized status, counts, commit hash, remote, branch, reason, and warning codes only.
