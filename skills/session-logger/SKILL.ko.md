# Session Logger Skill

Use this skill when the user explicitly wants session or handoff logging, or when a workflow reaches a finish/handoff stage.

## 역할

- keep active session state resumable
- record decisions, issues, and next steps
- prefer compact summaries over long timelines

## Default outputs

- prefer `docs/daily/YYYY-MM-DD/{runtime}.md` when the repo uses `docs/daily/README.md`
- otherwise use `{tasksRoot}/{feature-name}/session-logs/day-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- handoff target is `analysisContext.artifacts.handoffPath` or `{tasksRoot}/{feature-name}/HANDOFF.md`

## Minimum logging contract

- work start: goal, branch, initial scope
- decision: short reason and chosen path
- issue: problem, fix, rerun signal
- correction lesson: user correction, reusable pattern, affected guardrail, and whether a durable update was made or skipped
- completion: verification result and next step

## 명시적 호출

Use only when explicitly requested or required by an active workflow contract.

## 절차

- Keep logs within document ceilings; archive raw timelines and keep handoffs summary-first.
- Build compact finish-stage project knowledge context and record only status, evidence pointers, and reusable decisions.
- Keep finish logging read-only unless graph refresh is explicit; promotion candidates never authorize harness writes.
- Append corrections and promote reviewed remediation patterns only when justified.

## 중단 조건

Apply the existing operating-rule safety boundaries; this heading is typed for public-surface discovery.

## 출력 계약

Return written paths, record types, and any skipped or blocked reason.

## Project Knowledge Context Contract

Logs may reference compact knowledge status and provenance, never raw account-root knowledge state.
